New Energy Vehicle Sales Forecast and Regional Policy Effect Evaluation in China

As the global consensus on environmental protection and sustainable development goals 
strengthens, new energy vehicles (NEVs) have played a key role in driving the transformation of 
energy consumption and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As the largest market of NEVs in the 
world, the prediction of NEV sales and the assessment of regional policy effect in China are of 
significant importance for the industry development and formulating relevant policies. This paper
aims to provide recommendations for the continuous and healthy development of the NEV industry
in China by constructing a more accurate prediction model and quantitatively assessing the effects 
of regional policy implementations. Firstly, this paper analyzes the current development status and 
policy background of NEVs in China. Then it employs the traditional time series model SARIMA 
and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict the monthly sales of NEVs in China, 
comparing the accuracy of the models. On this basis, the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) is 
utilized to assess the specific impacts of two ‘non-subsidy’ policies, license plate restrictions and 
parking incentives, on the promotion of NEVs. The study finds that on the basis of considering 
macroeconomic and policy changes, the LSTM model has better prediction performance than the 
traditional time series model that only considers historical sales, and the MAPE is 12.91%. This 
paper predicts that the sales of new energy vehicles in China will exceed 1.5 million in December 
2024 by using the multivariate LSTM model. The application of SCM effectively assesses the 
effects of regional policies, revealing that license plate restrictions and parking incentives have 
played a positive role in the development of the NEV market. However, when regional governments 
promote these two policies in the future, more factors should be considered in order to encourage 
the healthy development of the NEV industry in China.
